                  <p>
                    House extension costs in the UK typically range from £1,500
                    to £3,000 per square metre, depending on the type of
                    extension, materials used, and location. A single-storey
                    extension usually costs between £1,500-£2,500 per m², while
                    a double-storey extension ranges from £2,000-£3,000 per m².

                  <p>
                    Many house extensions can be built under permitted
                    development rights, which don&apos;t require planning
                    permission. Single-storey rear extensions up to 4m for
                    detached houses or 3m for other properties are usually
                    permitted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, you&apos;ll need planning permission for larger
                    extensions, those in conservation areas, or if your property
                    has already been extended. Always check with your local
                    planning authority before starting work.

                  <p>
                    The timeline for building a house extension varies depending
                    on size and complexity. A simple single-storey extension
                    typically takes 8-12 weeks, while a double-storey extension
                    can take 12-20 weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Complex extensions with additional features may take 6-8
                    months. Factors affecting timeline include weather
                    conditions, material availability, and any planning
                    permission delays.

                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    The most popular house extension types include rear
                    extensions (most common), side extensions, wrap-around
                    extensions, and loft conversions. Rear extensions are
                    favoured for creating open-plan living spaces and kitchen
                    extensions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Side extensions are ideal for adding extra bedrooms or
                    expanding existing rooms. The choice depends on your
                    property layout, available space, and intended use.

                  <p>
                    There are several ways to finance a house extension:
                    remortgaging your property, taking out a home improvement
                    loan, using savings, or applying for a construction
                    mortgage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remortgaging is often the most cost-effective option as it
                    typically offers lower interest rates. Consider the total
                    cost including VAT, professional fees, and contingency funds
                    when planning your budget.

                  <p>
                    When designing your house extension, consider: the intended
                    use and functionality, natural light and ventilation, how it
                    connects to existing rooms, building regulations compliance,

                    energy efficiency, ventilation, and accessibility.

                    You&apos;ll need building control approval, which involves
                    inspections at key stages of construction. Your builder or
                    architect should handle the building control process, but
                    it&apos;s important to ensure all work meets current

                    A well-designed house extension can add significant value to
                    your property, typically 10-20% of your home&apos;s current
                    value. Kitchen extensions often provide the best return on
                    investment, followed by additional bedrooms and living
                    space.

                  <p>
                    The exact value increase depends on your location, the
                    quality of the build, and how well the extension integrates
                    with your existing property.

                    Common challenges include: managing the construction process
                    while living in the property, dealing with unexpected
                    structural issues, coordinating with contractors and
                    suppliers, managing noise and disruption, and staying within
                    budget.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good planning, clear communication with your builder, and
                    having a realistic timeline can help minimise these
                    challenges.

              question: "Should I hire an architect for my house extension?",
              answer: (
                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    While not always legally required, hiring an architect is
                    highly recommended for house extensions. They can help with
                    design optimisation, planning permission applications,
                    building regulations compliance, and contractor
                    coordination.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Architects can also help maximise your space and ensure the
                    extension adds value to your property. For complex projects
                    or if you want a unique design, an architect is essential.
