      question: "How accurate are these renovation cost calculators?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Our calculators provide estimates with 88-95% accuracy based on
          current London market rates and our extensive project database. They
          consider factors like property type, location, materials, and project
          complexity. However, these are estimates and final costs may vary
          based on specific site conditions and requirements.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What factors do the calculators consider?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Each calculator considers project-specific factors. Kitchen
          calculators include size, materials, electrical work, and plumbing.
          Bathroom calculators factor in size, layout changes, tiling, and
          fixtures. Extension calculators consider type, size, and finishing
          options. All calculators account for London labour rates and material
          costs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Are the calculator results binding quotes?",
      answer: (
        <>
          No, these are estimates to help you budget and plan your project. For
          a detailed, binding quote, we recommend booking a consultation with
          our team. We&apos;ll visit your property, discuss your specific
          requirements, and provide a comprehensive quote based on your exact
          needs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to complete each calculator?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Calculator completion times vary: Bathroom calculator takes 3-5
          minutes, Kitchen calculator 5-10 minutes, Extension calculator 8-12
          minutes, and General renovation calculator 10-15 minutes. You can save
          your progress and return later to complete the calculation.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Can I download my calculation results?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Yes! Most of our calculators offer PDF download functionality. You can
          save your detailed breakdown including costs, materials, and
          specifications. This is perfect for sharing with partners, getting
          additional quotes, or keeping for your records.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Do the calculators include VAT and other additional costs?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Our calculators include VAT and standard project costs. However, they
          don&apos;t include planning permission fees, building regulations, or
          unexpected structural issues. We recommend adding 10-15% to your
          estimate for contingency and additional costs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do your cost estimates cover?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Our calculators are calibrated for London market rates, particularly
          East, North, and Central London. Costs may vary for other areas. If
          you&apos;re outside our service area, the calculators still provide
          useful estimates, but we recommend consulting local contractors for
          accurate pricing.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How often are the calculator costs updated?",
      answer: (
        <>
          We update our calculator costs quarterly to reflect current market
          rates, material price changes, and labour cost fluctuations. This
          ensures our estimates remain accurate and relevant to current market
          conditions.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use these calculators for commercial properties?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Our calculators are designed for residential properties. Commercial
          projects have different requirements, regulations, and cost
          structures. For commercial renovation estimates, please contact us
          directly for a custom quote tailored to your specific needs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question:
        "What if my project is more complex than the calculator options?",
      answer: (
        <>
          For complex projects or unique requirements, our calculators provide a
          good starting point. We recommend booking a consultation where we can
          discuss your specific needs, visit your property, and provide a
          detailed custom quote that covers all aspects of your project.
