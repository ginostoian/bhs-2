            love for years to come. This article focuses on the specific

            Understanding Your Needs: Before You Start Searching
          </h2>

          <p className={styles.p}>
            Before diving into directories and review sites, take some time to
            define your project. This will help you narrow your search and
            communicate effectively with potential fitters. Consider the
            following:

              costs.

              envisioning. Gathering inspiration from magazines, websites like
              Houzz, or Pinterest can be incredibly helpful.

              positive reviews online (on platforms like MyBuilder, Houzz,
              Checkatrade, etc.). Don&apos;t just rely on the overall rating;

              materials.

            <li className={styles.p}>
              <b className={styles.accent}>Lack of a Contract:</b> Never proceed

            </li>

            After the Renovation: Snagging and Aftercare
          </h2>

          <p className={styles.p}>
            Once the renovation is complete, conduct a thorough inspection
            (snagging) to identify any minor defects or unfinished work. Create
            a snagging list and discuss it with your fitter. They should be
            willing to rectify any issues to your satisfaction. Also be sure to
            ask for the warranty period, and get it in writing. Good fitters
            will often have a 12 month workmanship guarantee as standard.

            bathroom. Proper cleaning and maintenance will help ensure that it
            stays looking its best for years to come. Consider asking for advice
            specific cleaning products for items such as{" "}
