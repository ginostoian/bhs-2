        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
          Before any work begins, our renovation team protects all the door
          openings to prevent dust from spreading to other areas in your home.
          We also protect the floors, furniture and your belongings so they stay
          in mint condition during the remodeling. Once everything is protected,
          we begin with demolition including fixture removal and wall tearing.
          Rest assured, we will work with you to plan accordingly and minimize
          any inconvenience.

      question: "How does payment work with Better Homes Studio?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
          We will ask you to pay a deposit upon agreeing to work together. The
          deposit ranges between £300 and £1,000 depending on the size of the
          project. Before starting the project, we will divide the remaining
          total by the number of weeks we expect the project to take and invoice
          you at the end of each week. There will always be 5% - 10% left to be
          paid after completion and snagging for your peace of mind.

          10 years depending on the project type. If you&apos;d like to find out
