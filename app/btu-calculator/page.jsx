                  <p>
                    BTU (British Thermal Unit) is a measurement of thermal
                    energy. In heating, it tells you how much heat a radiator
                    can produce. One BTU is the amount of energy needed to heat
                    one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For radiators, BTU ratings help you choose the right size.
                    Too small and your room won&apos;t get warm enough. Too
                    large and you&apos;ll waste energy and money. Our calculator
                    finds the perfect BTU for your specific room.

                  <p>
                    Measure the length, width, and height of your room in
                    metres. For irregular rooms, break them into rectangular
                    sections and calculate each separately.

                    Don&apos;t forget to measure ceiling height as it affects
                    the volume of air to be heated. Standard UK ceiling height
                    is 2.4m, but older properties may have higher ceilings.

                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Gas radiators are connected to your central heating system
                    and use gas to heat water that flows through them.
                    They&apos;re more cost-effective for whole-house heating but
                    require plumbing installation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Electric radiators plug into your electrical system and heat
                    up independently. They&apos;re easier to install and perfect
                    for individual room heating, but typically cost more to run.

                  <p>
                    Good insulation significantly reduces BTU requirements.
                    Well-insulated rooms retain heat better, so you need less
                    heating power. Poor insulation means heat escapes quickly,
                    requiring higher BTU radiators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Modern homes with cavity wall insulation, double glazing,
                    and loft insulation need 20-30% less BTU than older, poorly
                    insulated properties.

                </div>
              ),
            },
            {
              question: "Should I add extra BTU for safety margin?",
              answer: (
                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Yes, it&apos;s recommended to add 10-20% to your calculated
                    BTU for a safety margin. This accounts for heat loss through
                    windows, doors, and unexpected factors like drafts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, don&apos;t oversize too much. Radiators that are
                    too powerful can make rooms uncomfortably hot and waste
                    energy. Our calculator includes appropriate safety margins.

              question: "How many radiators do I need for my room?",
              answer: (
                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    You can achieve your total BTU requirement with one large
                    radiator or multiple smaller ones. Consider room layout,
                    furniture placement, and aesthetic preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Multiple radiators provide more even heat distribution. For
                    example, a 2000 BTU requirement could be met with one 2000
                    BTU radiator or two 1000 BTU radiators placed strategically.

              question: "Do windows and doors affect BTU calculations?",
              answer: (
                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Yes, windows and doors are major sources of heat loss.
                    Single-glazed windows lose much more heat than double or
                    triple glazing. External doors also contribute to heat loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our calculator accounts for the number of windows and doors
                    in your room. More openings mean higher BTU requirements to
                    compensate for heat loss.

                    Different rooms have different heating needs. Living rooms
                    and bedrooms typically need moderate heating, while
                    bathrooms often need higher BTU for quick warm-up and
                    comfort.

                    Kitchens generate heat from cooking, so they may need less
                    heating. Our calculator adjusts BTU requirements based on
                    your room type for optimal comfort.

                <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Once you know your BTU requirement, you can choose from
                    various radiator styles: panel radiators, column radiators,
                    towel radiators, or designer radiators. All can provide the
                    same BTU output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consider your room&apos;s style, available wall space, and
                    whether you need the radiator to double as a towel warmer or
                    design feature.

                  <p>
                    This calculator is designed for radiators, but the BTU
                    principles apply to underfloor heating too. However,
                    underfloor heating has different installation requirements
                    and heat distribution patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For underfloor heating, consider consulting a heating
                    specialist as the calculations involve floor construction,
                    pipe spacing, and heat output per square metre.

                Choosing the right radiator size is crucial for efficient home
                heating. Our BTU calculator helps you determine the exact
                heating capacity needed for any room, whether you&apos;re
                installing gas radiators or electric radiators. Understanding

                Why BTU Calculation Matters
              </h3>

              <p>
                BTU (British Thermal Unit) calculation is essential for several
                reasons. First, it prevents you from buying radiators that are
                too small, which would leave your room cold and uncomfortable.
                Second, it avoids oversizing radiators, which wastes energy and
                money. Third, accurate BTU calculation ensures even heat
                distribution throughout your space.
              </p>

              <p>
                Modern homes with good insulation require different BTU
                calculations than older properties. Our calculator considers
                insulation levels, room type, and the number of windows and
                doors to provide precise heating requirements.

                Gas vs Electric Radiators: BTU Considerations
              </h3>

              <p>
                Both gas and electric radiators can provide the same BTU output,
                but they work differently. Gas radiators are part of your
                central heating system and are generally more cost-effective for
                whole-house heating. Electric radiators are independent units
                that can be installed anywhere with electrical access.
              </p>

              <p>
                When calculating BTU for gas radiators, consider your boiler
                capacity and the total heating load of your home. For electric
                radiators, ensure your electrical system can handle the power
                requirements. Our calculator helps you understand these
                differences and make informed decisions.

                heating:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
                <li>
                  <strong>Room size:</strong> Larger rooms need more BTU to
                  maintain comfortable temperatures
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Insulation quality:</strong> Well-insulated rooms
                  retain heat better and need less BTU
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Window and door count:</strong> More openings mean
                  more heat loss and higher BTU requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Room type:</strong> Bathrooms need higher BTU for
                  quick warm-up, while kitchens may need less due to cooking
                  heat
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ceiling height:</strong> Higher ceilings increase the
                  volume of air to be heated
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>External walls:</strong> Rooms with more external
                  walls lose more heat
                </li>
              </ul>
