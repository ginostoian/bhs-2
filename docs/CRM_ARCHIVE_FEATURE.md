# CRM Archive Feature

## Overview

The CRM system now includes an archive feature that allows administrators to move completed or inactive leads to a "Finished" column, keeping the main kanban board clean while maintaining access to historical data.

## Features

### 1. Archive Lead

- **Location**: Each lead card now includes an "Archive" button below the stage dropdown
- **Functionality**: Clicking the archive button moves the lead to the "Finished" column
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/crm/leads/[id]/archive`

### 2. Finished Column

- **Location**: Added as a new column to the right of the existing CRM stages
- **Content**: Displays all archived leads
- **Styling**: Gray-themed column to distinguish it from active leads
- **Counter**: Shows the total number of archived leads

### 3. Collapsible Design

- **Toggle Button**: Click the arrow button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è/üîΩ) to collapse/expand the Finished column
- **State Persistence**: The collapsed state is maintained during the session
- **Visual Feedback**: Collapsed column shows reduced opacity and hides content
- **Space Saving**: When collapsed, the column takes minimal space on the page

### 4. Archived Lead Cards

- **Visual Design**: Gray-themed cards with archive-specific styling
- **Archive Information**: Shows when and by whom the lead was archived
- **Smart Date Formatting**: Displays relative time (e.g., "2 days ago", "3 weeks ago")
- **Unarchive Button**: Allows leads to be moved back to active status
- **Full Functionality**: Archived leads can still be viewed, edited, and managed

### 5. Unarchive Lead

- **Functionality**: Click the "Unarchive" button to restore a lead to active status
- **API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/crm/leads/[id]/archive`
- **State Management**: Lead is automatically moved back to the appropriate stage column
